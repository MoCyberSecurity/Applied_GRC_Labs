# Applied GRC Labs – ISO 27001 in Practice

This section demonstrates **hands-on application of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) principles** aligned with **ISO/IEC 27001** and mapped to the **CISM leadership mindset**.

Each lab represents a practical case study showing how an Information Security Management System (ISMS) is designed, operated, and assured in a real business environment — from scoping and risk assessment to incident response and audit readiness.

These labs emphasize:
- Strategic governance alignment
- Risk-based decision making
- Control selection and justification
- Policy framework development
- Incident management integration
- Continual improvement
